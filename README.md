# CrossWeaver

This service, called CrossWeaver, is operated by validators who are responsible for monitoring events generated by YaPayLocker contracts on multiple blockchain networks. The primary function of CrossWeaver is to capture these event messages and securely submit them to Digichain, a decentralized ledger system. Additionally, CrossWeaver facilitates cross-chain transfers by enabling the seamless movement of digital assets between Digichain and other interconnected blockchain networks.
